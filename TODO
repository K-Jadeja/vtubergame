The above dynamic import cannot be analyzed by Vite.
See https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/dynamic-import-vars#limitations for supported dynamic import formats. If this is intended to be left as-is, you can use the /* @vite-ignore \_/ comment inside the import() call to suppress this warning.

- The model is 325mb and can be seen downloading on the networks tab. can we not make a better progress bar
- I increased the timeout to 160 secounds because the model was too slow to produce and we got the wrong error that the model did not load
- the motion and emotion buttons stop working after we make the model say something. they start working again if we change model and reload it. fix this
- I should be able to make the live2d model do expressions and motions while it is speaking but it get's stun locked and doesn't move during and after speech
