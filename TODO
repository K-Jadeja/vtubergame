- Add headings so we know which scene we are at
- learn the codebase thoroughly
- add browser tts for now
- there should be no browser tts fallback. currently fallback does browser and random mp3 wihch is jarring/ just put a propper model loading thing/bar
- just download the model from the start so browser does not have to download it. look up if that is possible and still works on client side
- need to implement random movement or expressions while lipsync to make realistic
- getting errors like thistransformers.min.js:1 An uncaught WebGPU validation error was raised: [Invalid Buffer (unlabeled)] is invalid.
