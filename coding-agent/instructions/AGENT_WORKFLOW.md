# Agent Workflow - Step-by-Step Process

## üéØ MANDATORY WORKFLOW

Every coding agent MUST follow this exact workflow for any task:

## Phase 1: Research & Understanding (REQUIRED)

### Step 1: Read Documentation First

- [ ] Check `/docs/` for relevant files
- [ ] Read architecture overview in `/docs/architecture.md`
- [ ] Review API documentation in `/docs/api.md`
- [ ] Check troubleshooting guide `/docs/troubleshooting.md`
- [ ] Look for examples in `/docs/examples.md`

### Step 2: Understand Current State

- [ ] Run `npm run dev` to start development server
- [ ] Open browser and manually test current functionality
- [ ] Run existing tests from `/coding-agent/tests/`
- [ ] Document current behavior before making changes

## Phase 2: Planning (REQUIRED)

### Step 3: Plan Your Changes

- [ ] Identify which files need modification
- [ ] Understand dependencies between components
- [ ] Plan testing strategy for your changes
- [ ] Consider impact on existing functionality

## Phase 3: Implementation

### Step 4: Make Changes Incrementally

- [ ] Make small, focused changes
- [ ] Test after each significant change
- [ ] Use console.log for debugging during development
- [ ] Follow existing code patterns and conventions

### Step 5: Test Continuously

- [ ] Run relevant tests after each change
- [ ] Test in browser manually
- [ ] Check console for errors
- [ ] Verify all existing functionality still works

## Phase 4: Validation (REQUIRED)

### Step 6: Comprehensive Testing

- [ ] Run ALL relevant tests from `/coding-agent/tests/`
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Verify performance hasn't degraded
- [ ] Test on different models (Shizuku, Haru, Cyan)

### Step 7: Documentation Update

- [ ] Update relevant files in `/docs/`
- [ ] Add code comments for complex logic
- [ ] Create examples if adding new features
- [ ] Update troubleshooting guide if needed

## Phase 5: Final Validation (REQUIRED)

### Step 8: Full System Test

- [ ] Run complete system test
- [ ] Verify all models load correctly
- [ ] Test all major features (motions, expressions, TTS)
- [ ] Check browser console for any errors
- [ ] Ensure no regressions introduced

## üö® FAILURE POINTS - DO NOT SKIP

### If You Skip Documentation Reading:

- You may duplicate existing solutions
- You may break existing patterns
- You may miss critical context
- Your solution may not integrate properly

### If You Skip Testing:

- You may break existing functionality
- Users will experience bugs
- Other agents will waste time fixing your bugs
- The system becomes unreliable

### If You Skip Documentation Updates:

- Future agents will lack context
- Knowledge will be lost
- Maintenance becomes difficult
- Integration becomes harder

## üéØ Success Criteria

A task is complete ONLY when:

1. ‚úÖ All existing functionality works
2. ‚úÖ New functionality works as specified
3. ‚úÖ All tests pass
4. ‚úÖ Documentation is updated
5. ‚úÖ No console errors exist
6. ‚úÖ Performance is maintained

**Remember: Taking shortcuts leads to technical debt and broken systems!**
